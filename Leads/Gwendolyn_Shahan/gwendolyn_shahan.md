* Business Model:
    * Statistically, the average Land sale timeline is between 6 - 12 months
    * Our aim is to sell the property within 6 - 8 weeks
    * We are going to form a contract with you
    * We will locate a secondary buyer and either:
        * Sell them the contract (called assignement) with an upcharge
        * Conduct a Sales process called double closing where the sale and buying of the property occures in a back to back transaction
* Q/A:
    * Why can't I just Sell this property myself?
        * No reason.  Statistically the average sale time with a realtor is 6-12 months.  With us, we are guaranteeing 4-6 weeks
    * Why is the Offer so low?
        * We are going to be wholesaling this property.  This is lower than market value, but on the flip side you'll be getting cash for it within 6 weeks as apposed to 12 months
